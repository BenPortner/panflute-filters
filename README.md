# panflute-filters: pandoc filters built with [panflute](https://github.com/sergiocorreia/panflute)

A collection of useful Pandoc packages that use ``panflute``.


Some filters add or customize media to a document:

- pandoc-figures: figures with captions and backmatter support
- pandoc-tables: tables with captions, backmatter support, csv support
- pandoc-algorithms: support for tex algorithm packages
- pandoc-tex: replace arbitrary tex templates
- pandoc-media: all of the above

Other filters deal with backmatter, reformat the document, add tables of content, etc.
